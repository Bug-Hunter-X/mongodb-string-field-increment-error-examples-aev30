# Incorrect use of $inc operator with a string field in MongoDB

This example demonstrates an incorrect use of the `$inc` operator in MongoDB, which results in an error.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numeric fields. Attempting to use it with a string field will throw an error.

## Bug
The bug lies in attempting to increment a string field using `$inc`.  The correct approach involves updating the field using other operators, such as `$set` if you are replacing the value entirely or using a different approach depending on the expected outcome.

## Solution
The solution involves changing the update operation to correctly handle the string field. The appropriate operator depends on the intended operation. The code below offers solutions using `$set`, appropriate for updating to a numerical representation of the string value.
